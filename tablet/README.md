#Home made tablet


## Story 
This is a tablet made for my 6 years old daugther's birthday.

Last year I offered her a kano computer kit. https://kano.me/store/eu/products/kano-kit

She enjoyed a lot to built it up. And she plays mostly cartoon with kodi, Minecraft and Gcompris.

So for Christmas I bought the kano screen kit. We were disappointed that the screen were not touchable.

Moreover the plastic clips for the raspberry were weak and break fastly. And due to the opened back side, battery i had and other stuff drop all the time from the screen.

For her birthday she asked for a tablet I decided to embedded her kano computer kit into a touchable screen kit.

## Material:

WARNING: the screen power supply is in 12v and raspberry in 5v so I chose this battery because it could fit into the screen case sandwich at the side and it can provide USB and 12v.

I recommend to turn screen controller connectors to the inside and raspberry pi USB ports to the top.
